          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            The coronavirus pandemic is spreading around the world.
            You are an amateur helicopter pilot who is instructed to deliver crucial N95 face masks
            to medical staff in a remote town. However, you only found a narrow hill where you
            can drop off these N95 boxes. Try your best to drop as many as possible, but don't
            let them fall off the clif!
          </p>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
            Click or tap the game screen in the middle to let the box drop. The remaining time
            displays on the top left corner of the screen. When the time is out, the game counts
            how many boxes are survived, then shows you a summary window.
          </p>
          <h2>Difficulty</h2>
          <p>
            There are two difficulties:<br>
            Easy: normal speed, heavy boxes, time limit is 30 seconds <br>
            Hard: higher speed, lighter boxes, time limit is 20 seconds
          </p>
          <h2>Scoring</h2>
          <p>
            Players who have more boxes survived will earn a higher score; if two players
            have the same amount of boxes survived, the one who drops fewer boxes in total
            earns a higher score.
